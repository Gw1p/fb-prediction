# Using Non-Standard Models for Football Predictions: Elo, TrueSkill, Neural Networks
## by Anton Bendrikov
## Supervisor: Prof. Paul Krause

All the code is within a single Jupyter Notebook `ab01719.ipynb`.

The file should be followed from the top to bottom. It starts by importing all the data, running tests and pre-processing.

Then, the file is split in sections with appropriate headings:

- Elo-related operations can be found under Elo
- TrueSkill model is developed under TrueSkill
- Neural Network is the largest section and contains all the workings for developing an MLP

---

Models' sections generally parse the data into correct format and setup the required dependencies, then grid-search the relevant parameters before presenting final evaluation.
